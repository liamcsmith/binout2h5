Software: binout2h5
Author:   Liam Smith

Installing:
In order to install the executable, you will need to have python3 and pip 
with the following packages:
    sys
    os
    argparse
    lasso
    pyinstaller
Then you will need to call "make" from a terminal in the directory. If you 
are on windows it is likely this wont work, instead enter the following 
command from a command line in the directory:
    pyinstaller --onefile binout2h5.py
Which should generate an executable.

Running:
The executable in its simplest form can  be run as such:
    ./binout2h5 <path/to/binout>
This will generate a binouthdf5.h5 file in the directory where the 
execuatble is located. Should you wish to place the output file in a 
specific location use the --output argument as such:
    ./binout2h5 <path/to/binout> --output=<path/to/desired/output/filename>
Where the filename must include the .h5 extension. If you supply an output
path without a .h5 extension the program will assume its a folder, and then
it will write binouthdf5.h5 to that folder.

Credits:
The lasso-python package from lasso.gmbh does the vast majority of the
lifting here, I merely wrote a wrapper that can be compiled into an 
executable, negating the need for use of a python shell every time.
